# test-time

AS A coding boot camp student I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

# Description

In this project we are tasked with building a quiz game to compete against our peers on the fundamentals of JavaScript. It needs to have a timer that begins once the game starts and if a question is answered incorrectly time is taken off from the timer in this case it is 10 seconds. The game also has to keep a record of high scores and display them to see how you compare against your peers who also have played the game. The game is also suppose to end either when all the questions have been answered or the timer reaches zero. 

# Usage

This is desgined to be a fun way to study with a little bit of competiveness. After clicking start quiz you will have 60 seconds to answer all the question, upon answering one question right or wrong the next question will be displayed. At the end you can type your name in the bar and click submit to save it. You can alos click restart quiz to take it again and try to get the best score you can in this case it is limited to 8.
